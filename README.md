- ðŸ‘‹ Hi, my name is Noah Shabazz. I am a 17 year old high school senior in the United States. The classes and courses I am most interested in are chemistry and computer science.
(HgBr2 is the compound formula for Mercuric Bromide)
- I have been studying Python for about 10 months and just recently I started learning C++. I have about 3 months of experience using HTML and CSS.
- I am looking to get my Computer Science Degree in either Software Engineering or Cyersecurity.
- I have obtained my Python 101 and Python 202 certificate through Unlock Academy and I am currently working towards becoming a certified python developer.
